## üîç Feature Importance Analysis

### Top 10 Most Important Features (Random Forest)

The Random Forest model identified these features as most predictive:

1. **Time-series lag features** (t-1, t-3, t-6 hours)
   - Historical values strongly predict future events
   
2. **Rolling statistics** (3h, 6h, 12h windows)
   - Short-term trends are highly informative
   
3. **Rate of change features**
   - Rapid changes in temperature, humidity, pressure
   
4. **Atmospheric indices**
   - CAPE, Lifted Index contribute to prediction
   
5. **Interaction features**
   - Temperature √ó Humidity relationships

**Key Insight**: Recent history (1-6 hours) is more important than long-term trends (24+ hours) for cloud burst prediction.

## üö® Class Imbalance Handling

### Challenge
- **Original**: 2.09% positive class (highly imbalanced)
- **Risk**: Models biased toward predicting negative class

### Solution Applied
1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
   - Generated synthetic positive examples
   - Increased positive class to 50% of negative class
   
2. **Random Undersampling**
   - Reduced negative class samples
   - Final ratio: 80% negative, 20% positive (approximately)

3. **Class Weights**
   - Applied to SVM and LSTM
   - Penalizes misclassifying minority class more

### Results
- ‚úÖ Random Forest: Perfect classification despite imbalance
- ‚úÖ SVM: Strong performance (F1: 0.8108)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LSTM: Still struggled with minority class

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Synthetic Target Variable
- **Issue**: Real cloud burst events (2023-2024) don't overlap with weather data (2025)
- **Solution Applied**: Created synthetic target based on extreme weather conditions
- **Impact**: Models trained on synthetic data may not generalize to real events
- **Recommendation**: Collect real cloud burst events for 2025 or historical weather data for 2023-2024

### 2. Perfect Random Forest Performance
- **Observation**: 100% accuracy on test set is unusually high
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Synthetic target may be too "clean" and pattern-based
  - Test set may not represent true distribution
  - Potential data leakage (though splits were proper)
- **Recommendation**: Validate on completely independent real-world data before deployment

### 3. LSTM Poor Performance
- **Issue**: Failed to learn minority class patterns
- **Root Causes**:
  - Insufficient positive examples for sequence learning
  - Weak temporal dependencies in data
  - May need longer sequences (48+ hours)
  - Architecture may be too simple
- **Recommendations**:
  - Collect more cloud burst event data
  - Try attention mechanisms
  - Use pre-trained weather models
  - Consider Transformer architectures

### 4. Class Imbalance Persistence
- **Original**: 2.09% positive class
- **Despite SMOTE**: Still challenging for some models
- **Recommendation**: Collect more real positive examples or use ensemble methods

## üéì Lessons Learned

   - Class weights + resampling combination works well

3. **Feature Engineering is Critical**
   - Time-series features from Sprint 2 were crucial
   - Historical lags are highly predictive for cloud bursts

4. **Validation on Real Data is Essential**
   - Perfect test performance may indicate synthetic data issues
   - Always validate on real-world scenarios

5. **LSTM Requires Abundant Data**
