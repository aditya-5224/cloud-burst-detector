# Historical Data Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the historical data integration features in the Cloud Burst Prediction System. Historical data allows you to:

1. **Validate Model Accuracy** - Test your model against known cloud burst events
2. **Improve Model Training** - Use real events to retrain and enhance predictions
3. **Analyze Patterns** - Study weather conditions leading to cloud bursts
4. **Build Confidence** - Demonstrate model performance with historical validation

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Collect Historical Data for Known Events

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run historical data collection
python src/data/historical_weather.py
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches weather data for 10+ known cloud burst events from 2016-2023
- Collects 24 hours of data before each event and 6 hours after
- Saves combined dataset to `data/historical/historical_cloudburst_data.csv`
- Total ~300 hours of data from real cloud burst situations

**Output:**
```
Building historical dataset from 10 events...
Processing event 1/10: Kedarnath, Uttarakhand
‚úÖ Collected 30 records for Kedarnath, Uttarakhand
...
‚úÖ Historical dataset saved: data/historical/historical_cloudburst_data.csv
   Total records: 300+
   Events covered: 10
```

---

### 2. Validate Model Against Historical Events

```powershell
# Run historical validation
python src/models/historical_validation.py
```

**What it does:**
- Tests your trained model against each historical event
- Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- Measures warning time (how early did model predict?)
- Generates detailed validation report

**Output:**
```
Validating Event 1/10: Kedarnath, Uttarakhand
Date: 2023-07-09
================================================
üìä Event Results:
   Accuracy: 78%

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "No historical data collected"

**Cause:** API rate limiting or connectivity issues

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check internet connection
ping api.open-meteo.com

# Run with longer delays
# Edit src/data/historical_weather.py
# Increase: time.sleep(2) to time.sleep(5)

# Try again
python src/data/historical_weather.py
```

---

### Issue 2: "Model not found" during validation

**Cause:** Model hasn't been trained yet

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Train model first
python src/models/train.py

# Then validate
python src/models/historical_validation.py
```

---

### Issue 3: Low validation accuracy (<50%)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Model undertrained
2. Feature mismatch
3. Data quality issues

**Solutions:**
1. Retrain with more data epochs
2. Verify feature engineering matches training
3. Check historical data quality

---

### Issue 4: Date range too long error

**Cause:** Open-Meteo API limits to 1 year per request

**Solution:**
```python
# Split into smaller chunks
for year in range(2020, 2024):
    df = collector.fetch_date_range_data(
        latitude=lat,
        longitude=lon,
        start_date=f"{year}-01-01",
        end_date=f"{year}-12-31",
        location_name=location
    )
```
