## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### 1. Timestamp Handling
- Used ISO format strings for SQLite compatibility
- Proper datetime conversion in all modules

### 2. Data Quality
- Handled infinite values (2,956 instances â†’ 0)
- Removed constant columns (194 features)
- Filled missing values from rolling operations
- Forward/backward fill strategy

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Vectorized operations in feature engineering
- Parallel processing in Random Forest
- Efficient correlation calculations
- Memory-efficient data handling

### 4. Target Variable Creation
**Issue Identified**: Cloud burst events (2023-2024) don't overlap with weather data (2025)

**Solution**: Created synthetic target based on extreme weather conditions:
- Heavy precipitation (>5 mm/h)
- High humidity (>90%) + high temperature (>30Â°C) + strong winds (>15 m/s)

**Result**: 90 synthetic events (2.09% positive class)

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Target Variable Mismatch
- **Issue**: Cloud burst events from 2023-2024 don't match weather data from 2025
- **Impact**: Using synthetic targets for model training
- **Solution**: Need to collect real cloud burst events for 2025 or historical weather data for 2023-2024

### 2. Class Imbalance
- **Current**: 2.09% positive class (90 events)
- **Recommendation**: Use SMOTE or class weighting in Sprint 3
- **Target**: Aim for 5-10% positive class for better model training

### 3. Atmospheric Indices Limitations
- **Issue**: Many atmospheric indices require multi-level pressure data
- **Current Data**: Single-level surface weather data only
- **Impact**: Simplified CAPE, LI, K-Index calculations
- **Future**: Integrate upper-air sounding data for accurate calculations

### 4. Performance Warnings
- **Issue**: DataFrame fragmentation during feature generation
- **Impact**: Slightly slower execution (~15 minutes)
- **Solution**: Can optimize with `pd.concat()` in future iterations
