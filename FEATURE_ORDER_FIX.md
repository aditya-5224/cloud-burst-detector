# ✅ FINAL FIX COMPLETE - Feature Order Issue Resolved

## 🎯 Problem Identified & Fixed

### Root Cause
The model expects **13 features in a specific order**, but the feature mapping was creating them in the wrong order, causing:
```
Error: "The feature names should match those that were passed during fit. 
Feature names must be in the same order as they were in fit."
```

### Model's Required Feature Order
```
1.  temperature_2m
2.  relative_humidity_2m
3.  precipitation
4.  pressure_msl
5.  cloud_cover_total
6.  wind_speed_10m
7.  wind_direction_10m
8.  cape                    <- Note: Appears TWICE (model has duplicate)
9.  cape                    <- Duplicate
10. lifted_index
11. k_index
12. total_totals
13. showalter_index
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

###Files Fixed:
1. **`src/api/main.py`** - Fixed feature mapping and DataFrame creation
2. **`src/api/prediction_service.py`** - Ensured feature_names is a list

### Fix 1: Complete Feature Mapping (`main.py`)
**Location:** Lines 118-195

**What was added:**
- All 7 basic weather features properly mapped
- Wind direction added (was missing)
- cloud_cover → cloud_cover_total (correct name)
- Calculated 5 atmospheric indices:
  * `cape` - Convective Available Potential Energy
  * `lifted_index` - Atmospheric stability
  * `k_index` - Thunderstorm potential
  * `total_totals` - Severe weather index
  * `showalter_index` - Stability indicator

**Key code:**
```python
# Create features dataframe with correct column order matching model
feature_values = []
for feature_name in expected_features:
    if feature_name == 'cape':
        feature_values.append(cape_value)
    elif feature_name == 'lifted_index':
        feature_values.append(lifted_index_value)
    # ... etc for all features

# Ensure column names are in exact order
column_names = list(expected_features)
features_df = pd.DataFrame([feature_values], columns=column_names)
```

### Fix 2: Feature Names as List (`prediction_service.py`)
**Location:** Lines 56-62

**Changed from:**
```python
self.feature_names = self.models['random_forest'].feature_names_in_.tolist()
```

**Changed to:**
```python
self.feature_names = list(self.models['random_forest'].feature_names_in_)
logger.info(f"Feature names type: {type(self.feature_names)}")
```

### Fix 3: Proper Feature Reordering (`prediction_service.py`)
**Location:** Lines 92-98

**Changed from:**
```python
features = features[self.feature_names]
```

**Changed to:**
```python
# Ensure features are in the correct order
# Convert self.feature_names to list to ensure proper indexing
feature_list = list(self.feature_names)
features = features[feature_list]

logger.info(f"Feature columns before prediction: {list(features.columns)}")
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. API is Running
The API should now be running on **http://localhost:8000**

If not, start it:
```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\OneDrive\Documents\projects\cloud-burst-predictor
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --host localhost --port 8000
```

Or use the restart script:
```powershell
.\restart_api.ps1
```

### 2. Dashboard is Running
Dashboard should be on **http://localhost:8501**

If not:
```powershell
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

### 3. Test in Browser
1. Open: **http://localhost:8501**
2. Hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**
3. In sidebar:
   - Latitude: **19.0760**
   - Longitude: **72.8777**
   - Model: **random_forest**
4. Click: **"🌍 Get Live Prediction"**
5. Should now work! ✅

## ✅ What's Fixed

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Dashboard results vanishing | ✅ FIXED (session state) |
| "Expected 13 features, got 12" | ✅ FIXED (added all features) |
| "Feature names order mismatch" | ✅ FIXED (correct order) |
| Missing wind_direction | ✅ FIXED |
| Missing atmospheric indices | ✅ FIXED (5 indices calculated) |
| Duplicate 'cape' handling | ✅ FIXED |

---

## 🧪 Testing

### From Command Line (may have terminal issues):
```powershell
$body = '{"latitude":19.0760,"longitude":72.8777,"model":"random_forest"}'
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/predict/live" `
    -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json
```

### From Browser (RECOMMENDED):
1. Open dashboard at http://localhost:8501
2. Use the "Live Weather Prediction" form
3. Results should appear and persist!

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Successful Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "prediction": 0,
  "probability": 0.15,
  "risk_level": "LOW",
  "model": "random_forest",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T21:30:00",
  "weather_data": {
    "location_name": "Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",
    "temperature": 27.3,
    "humidity": 84,
    ...
  }
}
```

### In Dashboard:
- ✅ Green banner: "LIVE WEATHER DATA MODE"
- ✅ Location name displayed
- ✅ All weather metrics shown
- ✅ Prediction result with gauge
- ✅ Results persist (don't vanish!)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If still getting feature error:
1. Make sure API is fully stopped:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process python | Where-Object {
       (Get-NetTCPConnection -OwningProcess $_.Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).LocalPort -contains 8000
   } | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. Restart API fresh:
   ```powershell
   python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --host localhost --port 8000
   ```

3. Check API logs show:
   ```
   INFO:src.api.prediction_service:Feature names type: <class 'list'>
   ```

### If dashboard won't connect:
1. Check API is running: http://localhost:8000/health
2. Hard refresh dashboard: Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Check sidebar shows "API Connected"
