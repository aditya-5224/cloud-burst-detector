# Cloud Burst Prediction System - Phase 1

A machine learning system for predicting cloud burst events using meteorological data and satellite imagery analysis.

## Project Overview

This MVP system ingests meteorological and satellite cloud imagery data, performs feature extraction, and runs baseline ML models to predict cloud burst events with 70-80% accuracy, exposed via a web dashboard and API.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated collection from weather APIs (Open-Meteo, WeatherAPI.com) and satellite imagery (Google Earth Engine)
- **Live Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data with location name resolution and multi-source fallback
- **Historical Data**: Database of 10+ known cloud burst events (2016-2023) with validation system
- **Image Processing**: Cloud detection and feature extraction from satellite imagery using OpenCV
- **Feature Engineering**: Meteorological feature computation including CAPE and Lifted Index
- **ML Models**: Baseline models including Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM
- **Model Validation**: Historical validation against real disasters with accuracy metrics
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard with live predictions, historical analysis, and maps
- **REST API**: FastAPI endpoints for predictions and feature access

## Historical Data Integration

**New Feature:** Validate your model against real cloud burst disasters!

### Quick Start with Historical Data:

1. **Test the Integration**:
   ```bash
   python test_historical_integration.py
   ```

2. **Build Historical Dataset** (10 known events, 2016-2023):
   ```bash
   python src/data/historical_weather.py
   ```

3. **Validate Model Performance**:
   ```bash
   python src/models/historical_validation.py
   ```

4. **View Results in Dashboard**:
   - Start dashboard: `streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py`
   - Click "ðŸ“Š Historical Analysis" in sidebar
   - Explore events, validation metrics, and patterns

### Features:
- âœ… Database of 10+ documented cloud burst events
- âœ… Automated historical weather data collection
- âœ… Model validation with accuracy metrics
- âœ… Pattern analysis (cloud burst vs normal conditions)
- âœ… Interactive dashboard with maps and visualizations
- âœ… Custom date range analysis for any location

### Documentation:
- **Full Guide**: See `HISTORICAL_DATA_GUIDE.md` (15,000+ words)
- **Quick Summary**: See `HISTORICAL_DATA_SUMMARY.md`
- **Test Script**: Run `test_historical_integration.py`

### Expected Results:
- Model Accuracy: 70-80% on real events
- Warning Time: 2-3 hours before cloud burst
- Validation against disasters from Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, J&K

## Phase 1 Goals
