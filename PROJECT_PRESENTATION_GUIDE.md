## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### The Real-World Crisis:

**Cloud Bursts - A Growing Threat:**
- Cloud bursts are sudden, intense rainfall events (>100mm in an hour) causing flash floods
- Result in massive loss of life, property damage, and infrastructure destruction
- Increasing frequency due to climate change (30% rise in last decade)
- Current warning systems have low accuracy and limited prediction time

### Impact Statistics:
- **Annual Deaths**: 2,000+ globally due to cloud burst-related flash floods
- **Economic Loss**: $10+ billion in damages annually in India alone
- **Warning Time**: Current systems provide only 15-30 minutes advance warning
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Existing systems have only 40-60% accuracy
- **Affected Population**: Over 500 million people in mountainous and urban flood-prone areas

### Why It Matters:
1. **Lives at Stake**: Inadequate warning systems fail to protect vulnerable populations
2. **Infrastructure Risk**: Roads, bridges, buildings destroyed in minutes
3. **Economic Impact**: Agriculture, tourism, and local economies devastated
4. **Climate Change**: Extreme weather events becoming more frequent and severe
5. **Preparedness Gap**: Need for accurate, real-time prediction systems

### Current Limitations:
- ❌ Traditional weather models update only every 3-6 hours
- ❌ Limited integration of multiple data sources
- ❌ Poor accuracy for localized extreme events
- ❌ No real-time monitoring and prediction
- ❌ Complex systems requiring extensive infrastructure
- ❌ Lack of accessible interfaces for common users

### Our Mission:
**To develop an AI-powered, real-time cloud burst prediction system that provides accurate warnings 2-3 hours in advance, potentially saving thousands of lives and millions in property damage.**
